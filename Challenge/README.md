# Cryptocurrencies
Using unsupervised machine learning modules to analyze cryptocurrency data.

# Purpose

With an understanding of what unsupervised learning is for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA it’s possible to create an analysis for potential clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

One of these clients, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the client is looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. Finally, we'll use the data visualizations to share the findings with the board of trustees.
